# About The Project
There are many documentation standards and styles. There are also many tools that can be used during analysis. There can be different levels of details described both on business and technical level. A lot of that depends on persons who are engaged in the project. 

But also **(dark music and serious tone)** documentation is crucial as it ensures that everyone involved has a clear understanding of the project's goals, progress, and technical details. 
Any misunderstanding in documents can result in more work that is spent on communication, unnecessary work or just trying to understand the contradictions that are contained.

So tl;dr:

Proper documentation facilitates communication, reduces misunderstandings, and helps in maintaining consistency throughout the project lifecycle.

But from first paragraph there is question ht is raising.


**Are there any costants?**

***Fortnately, yes!***

- Every documentation should be project specific.
- Every documentation should be customized for the audience.
- Every documentation should be easily readable.
- Every documentation should be changing as the product is changing. 
- Every documentation [...]

`You know what I mean.`

So **the only constant** in documentaton is **continous change** and adapting to it is the way to go.
