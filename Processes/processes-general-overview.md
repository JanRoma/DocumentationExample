# Current state of the processes

## Payment Process

Currently, the payment process at Pure Fun Amusement Park is handled manually. Visitors can only make payments at the park's ticket counters, which often leads to long queues and delays. There is no option for online payments, which limits convenience for visitors and reduces potential sales. The manual handling of payments also increases the risk of errors and fraud. Additionally, the lack of integration with modern payment systems means that the park cannot easily track and analyze payment data, leading to inefficiencies in financial management.

## Ticket checking

Employees manually check the tickets of visitors at the entrance points.
Each ticket is verified for validity, ensuring it has not expired and matches the visitor's identity.
Employees also ensure that the ticket type corresponds to the visitor's age and any special requirements.
Any discrepancies or issues are addressed immediately to ensure a smooth entry process for all visitors.

## Membership Program
Currently, the membership program at Pure Fun Amusement Park is managed manually. Members sign up at the park's office, where their details are recorded on paper forms. Membership cards are issued, which members must present to avail of benefits such as discounts on tickets, food, and merchandise. The manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies and a suboptimal experience for members.

## Maintenance and Inspection

Currently, maintenance and inspection processes are conducted manually. Maintenance staff perform routine checks and record their findings on paper forms. These forms are then submitted to the maintenance office, where the data is manually entered into a spreadsheet for tracking and analysis. This manual process is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to inefficiencies and potential safety risks. Additionally, the lack of a centralized system makes it difficult to track maintenance history and schedule future inspections effectively.

# Furure vision
## Payment Process

The payment process will be fully automated and integrated with online and on-site systems. Visitors will have the option to purchase tickets online through a secure payment gateway or at self-service kiosks located at the park. This will significantly reduce queues and wait times at ticket counters. The new system will support various payment methods, including credit/debit cards, mobile payments, and digital wallets. Real-time payment data will be captured and integrated with the park's financial management system for better tracking and analysis.

## Ticket Checking

The ticket checking process will be streamlined with the implementation of QR code technology. Upon purchasing tickets, visitors will receive a QR code that can be scanned at entry points using installed scanning devices. This will eliminate the need for manual ticket verification by employees, reducing entry times and minimizing errors. The system will automatically validate the QR codes, ensuring they are valid and match the visitor's identity and ticket type.

## Membership Program

The membership program will be digitized, allowing members to sign up online or at self-service kiosks. Member details will be stored in a centralized database, and digital membership cards will be issued. Members can access their benefits through a mobile app or by scanning their digital membership cards at various points within the park. This will enhance the member experience by providing a more efficient and error-free process.

## Maintenance and Inspection

Maintenance and inspection processes will be managed through a digital system. Maintenance staff will use mobile devices to perform routine checks and record their findings in real-time. The data will be stored in a centralized system, allowing for better tracking and analysis of maintenance activities. Automated alerts and scheduling will ensure timely inspections and maintenance, reducing potential safety risks and improving overall efficiency.
